+Marvell Armada 8K Plus Platforms Device Tree Bindings
+-----------------------------------------------------
 
-Boards using a SoC of the Marvell Armada 8KP families must carry
+Armada-8k-plus family will include several SoCs:
+Armada-8XXY:	XX - number of cores in the SoC (e.g. 08, 16, 32)
+		Y - number of CP-110 in the SoC (e.g. 1, 2, 4)
+For example:
+	Armada-8080: will include AP110 only with 8 cores
+	Armada-8162: will include dual AP110 with 16 cores & 2 CP110
+	Armada-8328: will include quad AP110 with 32 cores & 8 CP110
+
+Boards using a SoC of the Marvell 8K Plus families must carry
 the following root node property:
 
  - compatible, with one of the following values:
 
-   - "marvell,armada-8080", "marvell,armada-ap810-octa", "marvell,armada-ap810"
-     when the SoC being used is the Armada 8080
+SoC:
