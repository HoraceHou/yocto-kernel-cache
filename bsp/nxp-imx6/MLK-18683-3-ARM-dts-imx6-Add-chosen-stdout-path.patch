Subject: [PATCH 4104/5242] MLK-18683-3 ARM: dts: imx6: Add chosen/stdout-path

commit  308a9a2c6c165da09185bdb48c7e3a19ca062974 from
https://source.codeaurora.org/external/imx/linux-imx.git

This makes it possible to enable earlycon for debugging by just passing
an empty "earlycon" argument on the kernel command-line.
