Subject: [PATCH 3887/5242] MLK-18426 AMR64: dts: imx: Increase the cpuidle
 latency setting on imx8mm

commit  19d863b9294afb00cecab418167d89bcf0d7534e from
https://source.codeaurora.org/external/imx/linux-imx.git

After the WAIT mode is enabled on imx8mm, the previous latency setting
seems can NOT meet the system the latency requirement. audio playback is
impacted by cpuidle. So increasing the latency setting as large as possible
to eliminate the impact of system performance. The latency value is not very
accurate, need to be updated after we have enough performance test result.
