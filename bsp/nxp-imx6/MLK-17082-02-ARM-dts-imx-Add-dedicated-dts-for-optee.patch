Subject: [PATCH 2975/5242] MLK-17082-02 ARM: dts: imx: Add dedicated dts for
 optee support on imx6sl/sll

commit  c42a2709d168bfd3a3d0d77af8cd0ef504106f8f from
https://source.codeaurora.org/external/imx/linux-imx.git

Add dedicated dts file to support optee on imx6sl/sll. The OCRAM is resized
to make sure the OCRAM space used by TEE side is not visiable to no-secure
linux kernel side.
