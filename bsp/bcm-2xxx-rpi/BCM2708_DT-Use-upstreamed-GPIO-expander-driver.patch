Subject: [PATCH 186/198] BCM2708_DT: Use upstreamed GPIO expander driver

commit dd99439959e2dcf7907a1d2193ca31b2408b7621 from
https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux.git

The upstreamed driver for the GPIO expander has a different compatible
string. Change the relevant Device Tree files to match.

See: https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues/2704
