Subject: [PATCH 115/245] ARM: dts: ls1021a: Remove num-lanes property from
 PCIe nodes

commit 3eda2f9cb934b0bf8c9c0aedcde9f99469573599 from
http://source.codeaurora.org/external/qoriq/qoriq-components/linux.git

Remove the num-lanes to avoid the driver setting the link width.

On FSL Layerscape SoCs, the number of lanes assigned to PCIe
controller is not fixed, it is determined by the selected SerDes
protocol in the RCW (Reset Configuration Word), and the PCIe link
training is completed automatically base on the selected SerDes
protocol, and the link width set-up is updated by hardware after
power on reset. So the num-lanes is not needed for Layerscape PCIe.

The current num-lanes was added erroneously, which actually indicates
the max lanes PCIe controller can support up to, instead of the lanes
assigned to the PCIe controller. And the link width set by SerDes
protocol will be overridden by the num-lanes, hence the subsequent
re-taining will fail when the assigned lanes does not equal to
num-lanes.
