Subject: [PATCH 019/245] crypto: caam/qi2 - Increase napi budget to process
 more caam responses

commit d8e45266ebc0d0b76333580009c31921fc3f9087 from
http://source.codeaurora.org/external/qoriq/qoriq-components/linux.git

While running ipsec processing for traffic through multiple network
interfaces, it is observed that caam driver gets less time to poll
responses from caam block compared to ethernet driver. This is because
ethernet driver has as many napi instances per cpu as the number of
ethernet interfaces in system. Therefore, caam driver's napi executes
lesser than the ethernet driver's napi instances. This results in
situation that we end up submitting more requests to caam (which it is
able to finish off quite fast), but don't dequeue the responses at same
rate. This makes caam response FQs bloat with large number of frames. In
some situations, it makes kernel crash due to out-of-memory. To prevent
it We increase the napi budget of dpseci driver to a big value so that
caam driver is able to drain its response queues at enough rate.
