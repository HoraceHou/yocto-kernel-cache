-* Mmcoops oops/panic logger
+Mmcoops oops/panic logger
+=========================
 
-Mmcoops is an oops/panic logger that write its logs to MMC before the system crashes.
-Introduction and concept are similar to other oops logger.
-(Refer to Documention/ramoops.txt)
-- Disadvantage: if MMC is occurred an oops/panic, this logger can't work.
+Introduction
+------------
 
-After reboot, you can get the last log with below command.
-#dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=/tmp/dump.log skip=14680064 count=20; cat /tmp/dump.log
+Mmcoops is an oops/panic logger that write its logs to MMC before the system crashes.
+Introduction and concept are similar to other oops loggers.
+(Refer to Documentation/ramoops.txt)
 
 Required Properties:
+--------------------
 
 * compatible: should be "mmcoops"
-* start-offset: block-offset for start.
-* size: the number of block to write oopses and panics.
+* ``start-offset``: block-offset for start.
+* ``size``: the number of block to write oopses and panics.
+
+Example::
 
-Example:
 	mmcoops {
 		compatible = "mmcoops";
 		start-offset = <14680064>;	/* 14680064 * 512B = 7GB */
 		size = <20>;			/* 20 * 512B = 10KiB */
 	};
+
+
+Dump format
+-----------
+
+The data dump begins with a header, currently defined as ``====``, the dump then
+continues with the actual data. It is written in raw ASCI format.
+
+Reading the data
+----------------
+
+After reboot, the last log can be gathered with bellow command::
+
+ #dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=/tmp/dump.log skip=14680064 count=20; cat /tmp/dump.log
+
+- skip is the ``start-offset`` declared in device tree
+- count is the ``size`` value declared in device tree
+
+
+Choosing mmcblk used for dumps via sysfs
+----------------------------------------
+
+In order to bind different mmc device to mmc_oops the mmcX:000Y can be unbind
+and then bind to mmc_oops::
+
+ # ls -al /sys/bus/mmc/drivers/mmcblk
+ drwxr-xr-x 2 root root    0 Mar 10 23:05 .
+ drwxr-xr-x 4 root root    0 Mar 10 23:05 ..
+ --w------- 1 root root 4096 Mar 10 23:05 bind
+ lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root    0 Mar 10 23:05 mmc0:0001 -> ../../../../devices/platform/ap807/ap807:config-space@f0000000/f06e0000.sdhci/mmc_host/mmc0/mmc0:0001
