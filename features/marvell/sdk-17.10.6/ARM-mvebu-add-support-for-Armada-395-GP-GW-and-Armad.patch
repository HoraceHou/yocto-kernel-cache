Subject: [PATCH 0293/1345] ARM: mvebu: add support for Armada-395-GP-GW and
 Armada-395-GP-EAP boards

commit  3262253e4c253ee005f7df57911bde12996d62e3 from
https://github.com/MarvellEmbeddedProcessors/linux-marvell.git

It occurs that there are 2 GP boards:
'armada-395-gp-eap' and 'armada-395-gp-gw'
This commit introduces two new dts for each baord and abstract common
nodes to: armada-395-gp.dtsi
