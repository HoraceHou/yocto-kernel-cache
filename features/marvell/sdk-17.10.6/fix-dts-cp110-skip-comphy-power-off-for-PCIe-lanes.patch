Subject: [PATCH 1225/1345] fix: dts: cp110: skip comphy power off for PCIe
 lanes

commit  36459e3f00c1e9997a224e30ff7b191f06c6b3f8 from
https://github.com/MarvellEmbeddedProcessors/linux-marvell.git

PCIe comphy driver introduced an issue with detection of
SATA disks over PCIe.

This patch is a WA for this issue, which skips PCIe COMPHY
power off (triggered in COMPHY probe stage). With this WA,
and without associating PCIe to their COMPHY lanes, proper
functionality of PCIe COMPHY lanes depends on U-Boot
initialization, and these will be removed once SATA
detection issues will be resolved.
