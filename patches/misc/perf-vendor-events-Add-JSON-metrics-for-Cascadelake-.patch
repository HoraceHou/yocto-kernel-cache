The counter update is done at a lower clock rate then the core clock the overflow status bit for this counter may appear 'sticky'.  After the counter has overflowed and software clears the overflow status bit and resets the counter to less than MAX. The reset value to the counter is not clocked immediately so the overflow status bit will flip 'high (1)' and generate another PMI (if enabled) after which the reset value gets clocked into the counter.
