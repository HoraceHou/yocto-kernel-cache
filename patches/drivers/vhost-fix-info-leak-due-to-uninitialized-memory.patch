Subject: [PATCH] vhost: fix info leak due to uninitialized memory

commit 670ae9caaca467ea1bfd325cb2a5c98ba87f94ad upstream

struct vhost_msg within struct vhost_msg_node is copied to userspace.
Unfortunately it turns out on 64 bit systems vhost_msg has padding after
type which gcc doesn't initialize, leaking 4 uninitialized bytes to
userspace.

This padding also unfortunately means 32 bit users of this interface are
broken on a 64 bit kernel which will need to be fixed separately.

Fixes: CVE-2018-1118
