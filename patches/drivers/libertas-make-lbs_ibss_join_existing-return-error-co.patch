Subject: [PATCH 3/3] libertas: make lbs_ibss_join_existing() return error code
 on rates overflow

Commit e5e884b42639 ("libertas: Fix two buffer overflows at parsing bss
descriptor") introduced a bounds check on the number of supplied rates to
lbs_ibss_join_existing() and made it to return on overflow.

However, the aforementioned commit doesn't set the return value accordingly
and thus, lbs_ibss_join_existing() would return with zero even though it
failed.

Make lbs_ibss_join_existing return -EINVAL in case the bounds check on the
number of supplied rates fails.
